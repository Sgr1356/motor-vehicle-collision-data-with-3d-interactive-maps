Build interactive web applications with Streamlit and Python
Use pandas for data manipulation in data science workflows

Build your first data science web app with the Streamlit library in Python. By the end of this project,
 you are going to get comfortable with using Python and Streamlit to build beautiful and
 interactive web apps with zero web development experience! We are going to load,
 explore, visualize and interact with data, and generate dashboards in less than 100 lines of Python code!

Task 1: Project Overview and Demo
Task 2: Turn Simple Python Scripts into Web Apps
Task 3: Load the Motor Vehicle Collisions Data
Task 4: Visualize Data on a Map
Task 5: Filtering Data and Interactive Tables
Task 6: Plot Filtered Data on a 3D Interactive Map
Task 7: 3D Interactive Map (continued)
Task 8: Charts and Histograms
Task 9: Select Data Using Dropdowns
	
Now, you are going to get comfortable with using Python and Streamlit to build beautiful 
and interactive web apps with zero web development experience! We are going to load, explore,
 visualize and interact with data, and generate dashboards in less than 100 lines of 
Python code! We will accomplish it by completing each task in the project:

ADAM it sopen source and popular already installed on lennox cloud 

steps:==========================================
1== open terminal in directory
then # atom .
2==streamlit run app.py
pandas for data manupulation and data loading 
import numpy
parse_dates to specify date and time format into pandas format
dropna values for latitude and longitude had to be specified as coloumns
inplace=true(Flag)
lambda function coloumn to  be converted into string typecast and then lower case
data.rename renaming coloums using lowescase function sepcify:coloumns operation inplace=True
crash_date_time rename data.rename and rename shoud be in Dictionary Format

now load Data 
and Decorate our function with st.cache  # @st.cache(persist=true)
lets display data on app using st.sub headerand then use St caller write st.write and pass data 

to  hide the data we used checkbox element with attribut False

and now lets calculate how many people injured usng pandas
from range of injured person from 0 to 19 and plot map() and filter data using people data value

to access variable within the query we use @ symbol followed by variable name

Deck jail is coustomzable 
by uber and open source a web geo powered framework specially designed fro exploring and visulizing data sets and skilled

so import pydeck in python for 3D interative map
pydeck doc mapstyle=mapbox://styles/mapbox/light-v9

import plotly library is larger library allows us to create interactive plots very quickly with provided that 
input are tidy data friends

create histogram with numpy by filtered data
use panda for dataframe pd.DataFrame
